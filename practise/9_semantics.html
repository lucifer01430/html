    <h1>Sementics in HTML</h1><hr>
    <p>In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)</p>
    <p>In HTML, semantics refers to the meaning of the elements we use. For example, the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is used to define a header for a document or section, while the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element is used to define a footer for a document or section.</p>
